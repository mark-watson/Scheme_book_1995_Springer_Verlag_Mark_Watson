Thank you for buying my Scheme book!  Follow the directions in
Appendix A to install the software.  The example programs are
in the ZIP file EXAMPLES.ZIP; decompress them by typing:

PKUNZIP EXAMPLES.ZIP

If you have Internet access, please look at Appendix B for
interesting Internet sites to visit.  I was restricted by
what I could fit on two floppy disks; there are other parts
of the MIT Scheme system that would not fit on these disks
that you may be interested in:

  1. Compiler for MIT Scheme to make your programs run faster
  2. An Emacs-clone editor, which is really the way that you
     want to develop Scheme software
  3. A new OS/2 version of MIT Scheme
  4. Other Scheme implenetations for UNIX, DOS, and the Macintosh.

Enjoy this book, and please read it with a copy of MIT Scheme
running on your computer, so you can explore the Scheme environment,
and play with and learn from the example programs.

Best regards,
  Mark Watson
